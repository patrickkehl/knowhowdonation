<p>It is right that time moves forward and know-how evolves. This means that simply applying 20 year old know-how will not lead to a competitive advantage. It will lead to result, but most likely not to the best result that is available on the market. The originators of the know-how might have developed the know-how further and they still contain a competitive advantage. This does not mean that the know-how is without value. It can be seen like basic research at universities. Research findings are published and available for everyone. There might not be a direct application, but further developments in whatever direction might start based on the public research results. The same could be said from timed know-how donations, with the big difference know-how donations always show a process that has an application. Basic research is located before any applications are defined and know-how donations deal with with applications. Both can be the basis of further development.</p>

<p>The goal would be to establish know-how donations as a wider know-how source than basic research. Know-how can be derived from every every human endeavor. This rich source is of highest interest for every inventor. No one would like to reinvent the wheel, even when the wheel is over 20 years old. Know-how of a younger age would of course be of even higher interest, but the concept is based on making 20 year old know-how available for everyone. Nothing prevents an interested party after consulting a know-how donation to contact the originators of the know-how and negotiate terms and condition for a transfer of actual know-how or to simply buy the up-to date product or service they offer. For the invenstors a know-how donation can be seen as a business card showing their capabilities.</p>

<p>Open source is a brilliant concept that is of tremendous value for the progress of humanity. The principle is clear, every know-how that is published now is var more valuable than the same know-how published with a 20 years’ time lag. Therefore the answer is also clear: Yes, it would be better if everyone just did open source projects. I full support this movement.</p>

<p>However, certain product developments require investments that cannot be amortized if the know-how becomes free immediately. Cannot translates in this context into will not be done unless there are donations to support the project. And even if there are donations, the development will adapt in speed to the available resources which can translate into longer development times.</p>

<p>Under these circumstances, I see an advantage of commercial products compared to open source products. The timed know-how donation concept could make the know-how of all areas with commercial products available for everyone. The time lag remains, but this know-how would otherwise not be revealed automatically instead of only occasionally.</p>

<p>Just on a side note, it is also possible to build a commercial operation based on an open source product. The open source product could for example be manufactured for the client. Or when the client builds the product himself, then a service operation for this product could be established. In my opinion the two concepts are very different. The timed know-how donation concept is very broadly asking what type of organization and processes is needed to realize the product or service. This means the two approaches can be combined harmoniously or they can be used independently from each. In my view the world becomes a better place when open source is used wherever possible and everywhere else the know-how is shared with an as short as possible delay. The aim of the know-how donation concept is to generate a paradigm shift in know-how transfer. The new state should be that on the one hand society expects a know-how transfer and on the other hand companies decide on their delay for sharing. The general idea is to establish 20 years as a standard and make compliance visible by certification. However, companies could also decide to reduce the delay to 5 or 10 years and also get certification. They could also decide on a longer delay, but this would then be outside certification.</p>
