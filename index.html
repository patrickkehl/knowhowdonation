                  <h2><a href="#">Know-How Transfer Paradigm Shift</a></h2>
    <p>The starting point for our journey are the questions how know-how is currently transferred and if we could do any better on a global scale. 
       It is very important to take a macroscopic angle when trying to answer these questions. Individual acts do not matter so much - What matters is the combined behavior of the whole human population. 
    </p>
    <p> There are cultural values and strategies behind our behavior. Human behavior is generally rather short sighted with a time horizon of a few years. 
    What changes if we view the transfer of know-how on generation-long timescales? Would there be a way to generate more know-how - making more know-how available for everyone?
    </p>
    <p> I believe we could accelerate our progress and prosperity tremendously by a paradigm shift in how we operate the transfer of know-how. 
    By making more know-how available to brilliant minds in the not too distant future, these minds will innovate from a richer pool of know-how, generating more know-how and especially generating know-how of a higher quality.
    It means increasing the global know-how generation rate - leading to a richer future for humanity.
    </p>
    <p>There are many areas to improve. For a start, when know-how is no longer actively applied, then essential parts are lost over time. Preventing this loss would already help.
    Know-how is generated by individuals with their own incentives. These incentives are very important for them to invest their time and resources into know-how generation. 
    However, know-how has by nature a timer on its usability for inventors. They might move after some years to another endeavor, or they might simply get old and start thinking on what to leave for future generations. 
    The nature to give something back to society is in us. What could be improved is our culture. Know-how donation could become a part of our culture and thereby we could change the future of humanity. 
     </p>
    <p>
    I reflected on a way to make little steps towards such a paradigm shift in know-how transfer. 
    Please follow me to read the <a href="/whitepaper/">white paper</a> about it. 
    The paper presents you the concept of timed know-how donations and how with time more and more people could apply it, leading slowly to a paradigm shift. 
    Once a critical mass is achieved giving becomes a natural part our operations. This is possible because a timed know-how donation minimizes potential negative impacts on business operations while making the giving transparent for society already today.
